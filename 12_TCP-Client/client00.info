* Ending connection:

	socket.end();
	socket.end("some string...");

* Getting user input:

When a Node process starts, process.stdin is a stream prepared to accept user keyboard input.

This ReadStream will emit “data” events, but only after you resume it; that stream is initialized in
 the paused state.You can resume it by calling the resume method on the stream:

	process.stdin.resume();

Now you have a writable stream to the server and a readable stream from the user input. 
 You can glue them together by using the pipe method like this:

	process.stdin.pipe(conn);


Now, every time the process.stdin stream is flushed 
 which usually happens after the user
  enters a new line character 
   the data is piped to the server through the conn writable stream.

* Reconnect to server:

	conn.on('close', function() {

		console.log('connection got closed, will try to reconnect');
		connect();
	});
