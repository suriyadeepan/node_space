* write to file synchronously:

	fs.writeFileSync("file_name",contents);

* write to file asynchronously:

	fs.writeFile("file_name",contents,function(error){

		// can indicate the end of file writing
		//  here...
	});

* why write to file asynchronously?

	- useful in logging the operations to a file
	   asynchronously...
